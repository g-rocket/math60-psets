	\begin{problem}[2.5.6]
		A rectangular stick of butter is placed in the microwave oven to melt. 
		When the butter's length is \SI{6}{in} and 
		its square cross section measures \SI{1.5}{in} on a side, 
		its length is decreasing at a rate of \SI{0.25}{in\per\min} and 
		its cross-sectional edge is decreasing at a rate of \SI{0.125}{in\per\min}. 
		How fast is the butter melting 
		(i.e., at what rate is the solid volume of butter turning to liquid) 
		at that instant?

	\begin{problem}[2.5.36]
		Suppose that you are given an equation of the form
		\[
			F(x,y,z) = 0,
		\]
		for example, something like $x^3z + y\cos z + \frac{\sin y}{z} = 0$. 
		Then we may consider $z$ to be defined implicitly as a function $z(x, y)$.
		\begin{subproblems}
			\subproblem Use the chain rule to show that if 
				$F$ and $z(x,y)$ are both assumed to be differentiable, then
				\begin{align*}
					\pf{z}{x} &= -\frac{F_x(x,y,z)}{F_z(x,y,z)}, \\
					\pf{z}{y} &= -\frac{F_y(x,y,z)}{F_z(x,y,z)}
				\end{align*}
				\begin{solution}
					
				\end{solution}
				
			\subproblem Use part (a) to find $\pf{z}{x}$ and $\pf{z}{y}$
				where $z$ is given by the equation $xyz = 2$. 
				Check your result by explicitly solving for $z$
				and then calculating the partial derivatives.

		A ladybug (who is very sensitive to temperature) is crawling on graph paper. 
		She is at the point $(3, 7)$ and notices that if she moves in the $\mathbf{i}$-direction,
		the temperature \textit{increases} at a rate of \SI{3}{\deg\per\cm}. 
		If she moves in the $\mathbf{j}$-direction, she finds that 
		her temperature \textit{decreases} at a rate of \SI{2}{\deg\per\cm}.
