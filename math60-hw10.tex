	\begin{problem}[6.1.34]
		Tom Sawyer is whitewashing a picket fence. 
		The bases of the fenceposts are arranged in the $xy$-plane as the quarter circle
		$x^2 + y^2 = 25$, $x,y \geq 0$, and the height of the fencepost at point $(x,y)$ is given by 
		$h(x,y) = 10 - x - y$ (units are feet). 
		Use a scalar line integral to find the area of one side of the fence. (See Figure 6.16.)

	\begin{problem}[6.1.40]
		You are traveling through Cleveland, 
		famous for its lake-effect snow in winter that makes driving quite treacherous. 
		Suppose that you are currently located 20 miles due east of Cleveland and 
		are attempting to drive to a point 20 miles due west of Cleveland. 
		Further suppose that if you are s miles from the center of Cleveland, 
		where the weather is the worst, you can drive at a rate of at most 
		$v(s) = 2s + 20$ miles per hour.
		\begin{subproblems}
			\subproblem
				How long will the trip take if you drive on a straight-line path directly through Cleveland?
				(Assume that you always drive at the maximum speed possible.)
				\begin{solution}
					
				\end{solution}
			\subproblem
				How long will the trip take if you avoid the middle of the city by driving along a
				semicircular path with Cleveland at the center? 
				(Again, assume that you drive at the maximum speed possible.)
				\begin{solution}
					
				\end{solution}
			\subproblem
				Repeat parts (a) and (b), this time using $v(s) = \frac{s^2}{16} + 25$ miles per hour 
				as the maximum speed that you can drive.
